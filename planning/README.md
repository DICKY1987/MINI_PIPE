# Planning

This folder contains TODO lists, task tracking documents, and planning materials for ongoing and future work.

## Contents

### TODO Lists
- Active task lists organized by theme or workstream
- Remaining tasks for various phases of development
- Cleanup and optimization tasks

### Planning Documents
- Task breakdowns and implementation plans
- Workstream definitions and dependencies
- Feature planning and roadmaps

## Purpose

This folder serves as the central location for:
- Tracking active and pending tasks
- Planning future development work
- Organizing work by theme or priority
- Coordinating multiple workstreams

## Usage

- Files prefixed with `TODO_` contain actionable task lists
- Review these files to understand what work is pending
- Update task status as work progresses
- Archive completed TODO lists to the `reports/` folder when finished

## Note

These are living documents that should be updated as work progresses. When all tasks in a TODO file are complete, consider moving it to the `reports/` folder for historical reference.
